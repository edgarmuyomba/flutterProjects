# flutterProjects
This is a collection my flutter projects

# Getting started
Make sure you have flutter installed on your machine alongside all necessary add-ons
Each project has a file named **pubspec.yaml** that contains a section referencing all the projects dependencies
In the projects base directory, enter the following command to install all the dependencies
```
flutter pub get
```
To run the project, use the command:
```
flutter run
```
or click the **run** button above the main() function in *lib/main/main.dart*
